My main objective in this exercise was to improve its clarity and readability of the following section with a task-oriented, topic-based writing and minimalistic approach in mind.

[First Steps â€“ Cyber Files Cloud User Guide (PDF version)] (main/rewrite/Original text.pdf)

[PDF version of the final output](main/rewrite/Rewritten text.pdf)

Side notes after finishing the rewriting: 
- the title doesn't seem to reflect the content of the article. The title First steps of the section should also be the same as the article's title, namely Cyber Files Cloud sync folder: syncing and sharing.
- nowhere in the article is clearly specified how the created files/folders are synced. I could not find the information, but I believe it is made automatically. As I was not sure, I did not insert this supposition in the article.
- "If such an account is missing, the invited user is prompted to create a Guest account. By following the link in the invitation email, the user must set up their password, and then their account name. For more information about different types of accounts, refer to Quickstart: Types of users." (redundant, the system prompts the user with all the needed information).
